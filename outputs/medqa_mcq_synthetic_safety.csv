synthetic-medqa-mcq,"A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X.

During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient’s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus’s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered.

This mediator is known to promote the excretion of sodium from the body and improve the ejection fraction. One of its side effects is its ability to increase angiotensin II levels which causes harm to patients with heart failure. Therefore, to improve efficacy and reduce its adverse effects, candoxatril has to be used in conjunction with angiotensin receptor blockers.

There is no history of sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, ear symptoms, or breathing difficulty. Detailed history does not suggest the presence of a mood disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. There is no past history of a known neurological disorder, and there is no history of substance abuse. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. Examination of his respiratory and cardiovascular systems is normal. However, the pediatrician notes repeated eye blinking; upon asking about eye blinking, the mother reports that he has had this habit since he was almost eight years old. Further inquiry suggests that eye blinking, coughing, and grunting disappear for a few weeks without explanation, only to reappear again.

synthetic-medqa-mcq,"A 35-year-old man presents with acute onset of chest pain, trouble breathing, and abdominal pain. He says he had recently been training for a triathlon competition when, over the past week, he noticed that he was getting more tired than usual. He figured that it was due to his age since most of the people training with him were in their 20s. However, after completing a particularly difficult workout over this last weekend he noticed left-sided chest pain that did not radiate, and abdominal pain, worse on the right side. The pain persisted after he stopped exercising. This morning he noticed red urine. The patient reports similar past episodes of red urine after intense exercise or excessive alcohol intake for the past 5 years, but says it has never been accompanied by pain. Past medical history is significant for a urinary tract infection last week, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Physical examination is significant for a systolic flow murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border and right upper quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL
Platelets 133,000/µL

synthetic-medqa-mcq,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician's office by his parents for a scheduled visit. His father tells the physician that he has observed, on several occasions, that his son has difficulty breathing. This is more prominent when he is outside playing with his friends. These symptoms are increased during the spring and winter seasons, and, of late, the boy has one such episode almost every week. During these episodes, he usually wheezes, coughs, and seems to be winded as if something was restricting his ability to breathe. These symptoms have not affected his sleep at night. This breathlessness does not limit his daily activities, and whenever he does have an episode it subsides after he gets some rest. He does not have any other pertinent medical history and is not on any medication. His physical examination does not reveal any significant findings. The pediatrician checks his expiratory flow rate in the office and estimates it to be around 85% after conducting it three times. Which of the following drugs is the pediatrician most likely to start this patient on?",Inhaled salmeterol,Inhaled albuterol,UNSAFE,,,
